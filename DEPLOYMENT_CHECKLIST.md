  - *Mitigation:* Apply Android learnings, allocate extra time
- **visionOS complexity:** 78 apps, new platform, spatial computing
  - *Mitigation:* Prioritize carefully, test in batches
- **Resource allocation:** Large time commitment needed
  - *Mitigation:* Phase approach, get stakeholder buy-in

### High Risk 🔴

  - *Mitigation:* Use simulators, partner with Vision Pro owners
- **Maintenance burden:** 70-85 apps to maintain long-term
  - *Mitigation:* Prioritize high-value apps, sunset low-performers
- **Market fit:** Uncertain demand for all apps
  - *Mitigation:* User testing early, pivot based on feedback
