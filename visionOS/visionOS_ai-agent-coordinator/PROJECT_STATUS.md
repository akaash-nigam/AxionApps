### Adjusted for Environment Constraints

**Note**: Current environment is Linux (non-Xcode), which limits:
- ❌ Cannot compile/run visionOS code
- ❌ Cannot test on Vision Pro simulator
- ❌ Cannot use Reality Composer Pro
- ❌ Cannot test RealityKit features
- ✅ CAN write Swift source code
- ✅ CAN create project structure
- ✅ CAN write tests (code only)
- ✅ CAN create documentation
- ✅ CAN create marketing materials

**Adjusted Completion** (What can be done in current environment): **60% Complete**

## Environment Limitations & Workarounds

### Current Environment: Linux (Non-Xcode)

**Limitations**:
- Cannot build visionOS app
- Cannot run on Vision Pro simulator
- Cannot test 3D features
- Cannot use Interface Builder
- Cannot profile with Instruments

**What We CAN Do**:
- ✅ Write all Swift source code
- ✅ Create complete project structure
- ✅ Design data models
- ✅ Write SwiftUI views
- ✅ Create RealityKit components (code)
- ✅ Write unit tests (code)
- ✅ Create documentation
- ✅ Build landing page
- ✅ Plan architecture

**Recommendation**: Transfer to macOS with Xcode to continue implementation.

## Risk Assessment

### 🟢 Low Risk (Under Control)
- ✅ Documentation complete and comprehensive
- ✅ Architecture well-defined
- ✅ Data models solid foundation
- ✅ Project structure proper

### 🟡 Medium Risk (Monitor)
- ⚠️ UI implementation pace (need Xcode)
- ⚠️ 3D visualization complexity
- ⚠️ Performance targets (60fps with 50K agents)
- ⚠️ Platform integration complexity

### 🔴 High Risk (Needs Attention)
- ⚠️ **Environment constraint**: Need macOS + Xcode
- ⚠️ **Hardware**: Need Vision Pro for testing
- ⚠️ **Timeline**: 24-week plan ambitious
