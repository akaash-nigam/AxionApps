# Spatial HCM
*Human Capital Management in Immersive 3D*

## Executive Summary

Spatial HCM revolutionizes Human Capital Management by creating immersive 3D environments where HR professionals, managers, and employees interact with people data in entirely new ways. Built for Apple Vision Pro, this platform transforms traditional HR processes into engaging spatial experiences that improve employee engagement, streamline talent management, and create more human-centered workplaces.

## Problem/Solution

**Problem**: Traditional HCM systems reduce complex human relationships and career journeys to flat, impersonal interfaces. HR teams struggle with employee engagement, talent visualization, and creating meaningful development experiences that reflect the multidimensional nature of human potential.

**Solution**: Spatial HCM creates immersive environments where employee journeys become navigable 3D spaces, team dynamics are visualized naturally, and career development happens through collaborative spatial experiences. Transform people management from administrative tasks into engaging, human-centered interactions.
