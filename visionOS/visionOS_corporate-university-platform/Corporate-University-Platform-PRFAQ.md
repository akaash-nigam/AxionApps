*Transform employee learning from passive videos to immersive skill-building experiences*

# Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Corporate University Platform revolutionizes workplace learning by transporting employees into immersive training environments where they practice real skills, collaborate with global colleagues, and learn by doing rather than watching**

**Using Vision Pro's spatial computing, employees step into virtual factories, practice customer interactions with AI avatars, perform complex procedures with hand tracking, and earn certifications through demonstrated mastery.**

**Cupertino, CA — January 20, 2025** — EduSpace Enterprise today announced Corporate University Platform, a groundbreaking learning system that transforms corporate training from passive consumption to active skill development. Traditional corporate learning relies on boring videos and multiple-choice tests that fail to build real competence. Corporate University Platform leverages spatial computing to create immersive learning environments where employees practice actual job skills - operate virtual equipment, handle difficult customer scenarios, collaborate on projects, and demonstrate expertise through performance, not memorization. AI tutors provide personalized guidance while spatial memory accelerates retention by 400%.

**Customer quote**
"Our technicians learned to service our new $2M machine by practicing on a perfect virtual replica. They could make mistakes safely, see inside the equipment, and repeat procedures until mastery. When the real machine arrived, they serviced it perfectly on day one. Traditional training would have taken 6 weeks and risked equipment damage - this took 1 week with zero risk." — Sandra Liu, Chief Learning Officer at GlobalTech Manufacturing.

**Spatial Experience**
The corporate university manifests as an infinite campus where each skill area has its own immersive environment. Manufacturing training happens in virtual factories with full-scale equipment. Sales training uses AI-powered customer avatars that respond realistically. Leadership development places managers in challenging scenarios with virtual teams. Collaborative learning brings global employees together as if in the same room. Progress visualization shows skill trees growing as competencies develop. Certifications are earned by demonstrating abilities, not passing tests. The entire learning journey becomes an engaging adventure rather than mandatory drudgery.

**Pricing & availability**
Corporate University Platform launches Q1 2025 at $99/user/month. Enterprise licenses from $499,999/year for unlimited users. Includes AI tutoring and skill assessment engine.

**Privacy & Spatial Data**

# Vision Pro Specific FAQ

## 1. Spatial Computing Value

### Why does this need to be a spatial app vs traditional 2D?
Traditional e-learning forces abstract concepts through videos and slides, achieving only 10% retention after one week. Critical skills like equipment operation, customer interaction, and emergency procedures cannot be effectively learned by watching - they require practice. In spatial computing, learners physically perform tasks, building muscle memory and spatial understanding. This experiential learning achieves 90% retention, 4x faster skill acquisition, and dramatically higher confidence when performing real-world tasks. The difference between watching a safety video and practicing emergency procedures in VR can literally save lives.

## 2. Comfort & Accessibility

### How do we ensure comfortable extended use?
Corporate training sessions typically run 1-2 hours, so the system optimizes for focused learning periods. Adaptive difficulty prevents cognitive overload by adjusting complexity based on learner progress. Natural break points between modules encourage proper pacing. Seated options available for all interactions, with standing experiences optional for enhanced engagement. Multiple comfort settings accommodate different learning styles and physical needs. Gentle introduction to VR prevents motion sensitivity issues.

### What's the minimum and ideal physical space?
Minimum space is a standard office cubicle or home office - all learning experiences scale to available space. Seated learners can access full functionality through gesture controls and gaze interaction. Ideal setup provides 2m x 2m for skills requiring physical movement like equipment operation or presentation practice. The system intelligently adapts experiences - large spaces enable walking through virtual factories while small spaces use teleportation. Remote learners get identical experiences regardless of location.

## 3. Technical Implementation

### How do we leverage Vision Pro's unique capabilities?
Hand tracking enables precise skill training - learners physically perform procedures, building muscle memory for real tasks. Eye tracking measures attention and comprehension, adapting content delivery speed. Spatial anchors allow persistent learning environments that remember progress between sessions. High-fidelity rendering makes equipment training indistinguishable from reality. Spatial audio creates realistic environments for soft skills training like customer service. AI processing enables responsive virtual humans for interpersonal skill development.

### What are the performance considerations?
The system renders complex training environments with photorealistic equipment while maintaining 90fps for comfort. Intelligent streaming loads content progressively based on curriculum paths. Local caching ensures smooth experience even with limited bandwidth. Cloud computing handles AI interactions and assessment processing. The platform scales from individual learners to simultaneous global training events with thousands of participants.

## 4. Multi-User & Social

### How does collaborative learning work?
Cohort-based learning brings global teams together in shared virtual classrooms where everyone feels present. Learners see each other as expressive avatars that convey engagement and understanding. Group exercises enable realistic team problem-solving. Mentors can join learner sessions to provide guidance. Peer learning happens naturally through observation and collaboration. Social features reduce isolation of remote learning while maintaining professional boundaries.

## 5. Success Metrics

### What are the key performance indicators?
Primary metrics include: skill retention improved 400%, time to competency reduced 75%, training costs decreased 60%, and employee satisfaction increased 85%.
