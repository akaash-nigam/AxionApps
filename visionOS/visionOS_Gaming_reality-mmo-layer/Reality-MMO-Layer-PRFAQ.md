  target_user: "MMO gamers and augmented reality enthusiasts"

**Cupertino, CA — January 20, 2025** — *WorldLayer Games* today announced *Reality MMO Layer*, a revolutionary massively multiplayer game that overlays a persistent fantasy world onto Earth itself. Traditional MMOs trap players in fictional digital worlds disconnected from reality. Reality MMO Layer leverages spatial computing to transform every real location into part of a shared game universe - your local Starbucks might house a potion shop, Central Park becomes a dragon's lair, and your apartment serves as your personal fortress. Actions persist globally, creating a living game world where millions of players' decisions shape the augmented landscape everyone shares.

```yaml
ai_spatial_analysis:
  spatial_problem:
    limitation_of_2d: "MMOs separate from real world"
    physical_constraints: "No connection to actual locations"
    missed_opportunities: "Real places could enhance gameplay"
    
  spatial_solution:
    3d_advantage: "Entire planet becomes game world"
    immersion_level: mixed
    interaction_paradigm: "Reality augmented with game layer"
    presence_factor: very_high
```

**Customer quote**
"*I claimed the coffee shop on my block as my guild's headquarters. Now when I grab my morning latte, I see our banners hanging virtually and guildmates' avatars planning raids. Last week, we defended it from another guild trying to conquer our territory. My daily routine became an epic adventure.*" — *Jessica Chang, Guild Leader*.

```yaml
ai_parse:
  spatial_benefit: "Real world locations gain game significance"
  before_visionpro: "Separate game worlds on screens"
  after_visionpro: "Living inside a planetary MMO"
  wow_factor: "Your neighborhood becomes questable territory"
```

**Spatial Experience**
Players see a persistent fantasy layer over reality - mystical crystals growing from buildings, quest givers standing on corners, and mythical creatures roaming parks. Real-world movement becomes game travel, with epic journeys requiring actual exploration. Claim territories by establishing guild halls in real locations, visible to all players passing by. Major landmarks host world bosses requiring hundreds of players gathering physically to defeat. Professions like blacksmithing set up shops other players visit, creating player-driven economies tied to geographic locations. Persistent changes like constructed bridges or defeated monsters remain for all players globally.

```yaml
