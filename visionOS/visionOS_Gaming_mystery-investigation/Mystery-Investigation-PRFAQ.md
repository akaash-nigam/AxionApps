# Press Release (1 page max, 400-600 words)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Headline:** *Mystery Investigation* transforms living spaces into authentic crime scenes where players become detectives solving intricate cases through spatial evidence discovery

```yaml
ai_parse:
  app_name: "Mystery Investigation"
  spatial_transformation: "Homes become interactive crime scenes"
  target_user: "Mystery lovers and detective game enthusiasts"
  spatial_value: "Physical evidence examination in 3D space"
```

**Sub-headline:** *Using Vision Pro's room mapping and object tracking, players investigate realistic crime scenes overlaid in their actual space, examining evidence with detective tools impossible in traditional gaming.*

```yaml
ai_parse:
  key_visionpro_feature: room_mapping
  spatial_differentiator: "Physical evidence placement and examination"
  replaced_experience: "2D point-and-click detective games"
```

**Cupertino, CA — January 20, 2025** — *Enigma Studios* today announced *Mystery Investigation*, a revolutionary spatial detective experience that transforms any room into an active crime scene requiring real investigative techniques. Traditional mystery games confine players to clicking through static screens, missing the tactile investigation process that makes detective work compelling. Mystery Investigation leverages spatial computing to place evidence throughout your actual space - fingerprints on your walls, clues hidden behind your furniture, witness testimonies that play out as holograms in your room. Players use realistic forensic tools to dust for prints, analyze blood spatter patterns, and reconstruct crime sequences in the very space where they "occurred."

```yaml
ai_spatial_analysis:
  spatial_problem:
    limitation_of_2d: "Point-and-click removes investigation realism"
    physical_constraints: "No physical evidence interaction"
    missed_opportunities: "Spatial reasoning crucial to crime solving"
    
  spatial_solution:
    3d_advantage: "Evidence exists in actual 3D space"
    immersion_level: mixed
    interaction_paradigm: "Natural detective investigation movements"
    presence_factor: high
```

**Customer quote**
"*I spent an hour examining the coffee table from every angle before noticing the microscopic blood spatter underneath - exactly where it would be in a real crime. When I finally connected all the evidence and the killer's hologram confession played out in my living room, I felt like a real detective.*" — *Sarah Chen, Beta Tester and Mystery Novel Author*.

```yaml
ai_parse:
  spatial_benefit: "Authentic investigative process through spatial interaction"
  before_visionpro: "Clicking through predetermined clue sequences"
  after_visionpro: "Physical investigation with spatial reasoning"
  wow_factor: "Evidence hidden in actual room dimensions"
```

**Spatial Experience**
Players begin cases as crime scene holograms materialize in their room, with evidence markers appearing on real surfaces. Using virtual forensic tools - magnifying glasses that reveal hidden details, UV lights that expose invisible clues, fingerprint kits that dust actual surfaces - players methodically investigate their transformed space. Witness interviews appear as life-sized holograms, suspects can be questioned in your living room, and case boards float in space for connecting evidence.

```yaml
ai_spatial_flow:
  entry_experience: "Crime scene materializes in player's room"
  core_interactions:
    - {gesture: "Evidence examination", action: "Pick up and inspect clues", spatial_feedback: "360-degree object analysis"}
    - {gesture: "Fingerprint dusting", action: "Brush motion on surfaces", spatial_feedback: "Print revelation"}
    - {gesture: "Photo documentation", action: "Frame gesture captures evidence", spatial_feedback: "Spatial photo placement"}
  spatial_anchoring: "Evidence locked to room surfaces"
  comfort_design: "Calm investigation pace, no sudden movements"
```

**Pricing & availability**
*Mystery Investigation launches Q3 2025 at $39.99 with seasonal case packs at $14.99. Season pass includes 12 monthly cases for $99.99/year. Early access begins June 2025 for pre-orders. Compatible with visionOS 1.0+ requiring room scanning.*

```yaml
ai_pricing:
  app_store_price: "$39.99"
  iap_options: ["$14.99 case packs", "$99.99/year season pass"]
  enterprise_pricing: "Educational licenses available"
  launch_regions: ["United States", "Canada", "United Kingdom", "Australia"]
  visionos_requirement: "1.0+"
  other_requirements: ["Room scanning", "2x2m minimum space"]
```

**Privacy & Spatial Data**
*Room mapping data remains on-device for evidence placement. No spatial data transmitted. Case progress syncs via encrypted iCloud. Voice recordings during suspect interviews processed locally.*

```yaml
ai_privacy:
  spatial_data_collected: [room_map, hand_position, voice]
  data_stays_on_device: true
  cloud_processing: ["Encrypted case progress only"]
  user_controls: [data_deletion, sync_opt_out, privacy_mode]

# Vision Pro Specific FAQ

## 1. Spatial Computing Value

### Why does this need to be a spatial app vs traditional 2D?
```yaml
ai_spatial_justification:
  impossible_in_2d:
    - {feature: "Evidence in 3D space", why_spatial_required: "Physical placement crucial", user_value: "Authentic investigation"}
    - {feature: "Room-scale crime scenes", why_spatial_required: "Evidence relates to real space", user_value: "Spatial reasoning puzzles"}
    
  better_in_spatial:
    - {feature: "Evidence discovery", 2d_limitation: "Click predetermined spots", spatial_advantage: "Search actual space", improvement: "400%"}
