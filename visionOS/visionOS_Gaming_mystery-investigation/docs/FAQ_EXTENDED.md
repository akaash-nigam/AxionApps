- **Example**: A fiber can be magnified, analyzed with a spectrograph, and compared to suspects
- **Multiple Analyses**: Different tools reveal different information
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Use all relevant tools for complete understanding
- **Cross-Reference**: Compare results across tools

### Q36: What does the magnifying glass do?
**A:** The magnifying glass allows you to:
- Zoom in on evidence up to 10x magnification
- See fingerprints and ridge patterns
- Examine fiber and hair details
- Spot trace evidence
- Read small writing on documents

**How to use**: Pick up evidence, grab the magnifying glass, and move it over the evidence to zoom in.

**A:** The UV light reveals:
- **Blood and bodily fluids** (invisible to naked eye)
- **Trace evidence** (hair, skin cells)
- **Hidden markings** (secret messages)
- **Biological residue** (saliva, sweat)
- **Pattern evidence** (spray patterns, contact traces)

**How to use**: Activate the UV light and shine it on evidence to reveal hidden details.

### Q38: How accurate is the DNA analysis?
**A:** DNA analysis in the game:
- **Accuracy**: 99.9% match confidence (like real DNA testing)

---

## Suspects and Interrogation

### Q41: How many suspects are there typically?
**A:**
- **Tutorial**: 3 suspects
- **Beginner**: 3-4 suspects
- **Intermediate**: 4-5 suspects
- **Advanced**: 5-6 suspects
- **Expert**: 6+ suspects

More suspects in harder cases means more complex evidence connections.

### Q42: Can I interrogate suspects multiple times?
**A:** Yes, absolutely! You can:
- **Interview Multiple Times**: Ask different questions each time
- **Revisit After Evidence**: Confront with new evidence
- **Watch for Changes**: Note how they react to new information
- **Catch Inconsistencies**: Point out contradictions in their stories
- **Apply Pressure**: Increase intensity if they're being evasive

Multiple interrogations often reveal more information.

### Q43: How do I read a suspect's emotions?
**A:** Watch for these indicators:
- **Face**: Flushing, perspiration, muscle tension
- **Eyes**: Pupil dilation, avoiding contact, rapid blinking
- **Voice**: Trembling, pitch changes, stuttering
- **Hands**: Shaking, fidgeting, touching face/neck
- **Micro-Expressions**: Brief, involuntary facial expressions

Stress indicators don't always mean guilt, but they indicate emotional response.

### Q44: What are micro-expressions?
**A:** Micro-expressions are:
- **Brief**: Last 0.2-0.5 seconds
- **Involuntary**: Impossible to fake completely
- **Revealing**: Show true emotions
- **Subtle**: Require careful observation
- **Game Feature**: Visible when suspects lie or feel stress

Pay close attention to faces during interrogation.

### Q45: Can I trick suspects into confessing?
**A:** Confessions aren't required to solve cases:
- **Evidence Alone**: Sufficient for accusation
- **Confrontation**: Can lead to admissions
- **Lie Detection**: Watch for inconsistencies
- **Pressure**: May cause them to break down
- **Confession**: Helpful but not necessary

Focus on evidence over confessions for reliable conclusions.

### Q46: What if a suspect's alibi checks out?
**A:** If an alibi is verified:
- **They're Usually Not the Culprit**: But exceptions exist
- **Focus Elsewhere**: Direct attention to other suspects
- **Find Gaps**: Sometimes alibis have time gaps
- **Question Verification**: Occasionally alibi witnesses can be bribed
- **Multiple Solutions**: In rare cases, verified alibi but still guilty

Always prioritize evidence over alibi claims.

### Q47: How do I know when someone is lying?
**A:** Look for:
- **Inconsistencies**: Story changes between interviews
- **Evidence Contradiction**: Statement contradicts collected evidence
- **Behavioral Cues**: Stress indicators when discussing certain topics
- **Logical Gaps**: Timeline or facts don't add up
- **Over-Explaining**: Innocent people don't need to over-explain

No single indicator proves lying - look for patterns.

### Q48: Can the actual culprit be the most obvious suspect?
**A:** Absolutely! And sometimes they're the least obvious:
- **Red Herrings**: False leads pointing to innocent suspects
- **Complexity**: Guilty party may not be obvious
- **Multiple Valid Theories**: Several suspects could seem guilty
- **Evidence Chain**: Must build logical connection
- **Focus on Facts**: Don't assume, follow evidence

The most obvious suspect is guilty about 40% of the time.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Q81: What's the best strategy for solving cases?
**A:** Follow this approach:
1. **Explore Thoroughly**: Find all evidence first
2. **Analyze Everything**: Use all relevant tools
3. **Interview Early**: Get initial suspect statements
4. **Build Timeline**: Map out when events happened
5. **Identify Connections**: Link evidence to suspects
6. **Form Theory**: Develop your primary theory
7. **Interview Again**: Confront with evidence
8. **Finalize**: Make accusation when confident

Systematic approach works better than random investigation.

### Q82: Should I solve cases quickly or thoroughly?
**A:** It depends on your goal:
- **Score Optimization**: Balance speed and thoroughness
- **First Playthrough**: Take your time, enjoy experience
- **Speed Run**: Quick solutions earn achievements
- **Learning**: Thorough investigation teaches more
- **Recommendation**: Go slow on first playthrough, try speedruns later

Both approaches are valid!

### Q83: What's the most common mistake players make?
**A:** Most common mistakes:
1. **Rushing**: Solving before finding all evidence
2. **Ignoring Details**: Missing small clues
3. **Forgetting Suspects**: Not interrogating all suspects
4. **Tunnel Vision**: Focusing on one theory too much
