# Press Release (1 page max, 400-600 words)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Headline:** *MySpatial Life* creates a virtual family that permanently inhabits your home, growing relationships and living full lives in your actual space

```yaml
ai_parse:
  app_name: "MySpatial Life"
  spatial_transformation: "Home becomes inhabited by virtual family"
  target_user: "Life simulation fans and casual gamers"
  spatial_value: "Persistent AI family in real environment"
```

**Sub-headline:** *Using Vision Pro's persistent spatial anchoring and advanced AI, watch virtual family members develop personalities, form relationships, and live complete lives synchronized with your daily routines.*

```yaml
ai_parse:
  key_visionpro_feature: persistent_spatial_anchoring
  spatial_differentiator: "AI family lives continuously in your space"
  replaced_experience: "Screen-based life simulations"
```

**Cupertino, CA — January 20, 2025** — *LifeSpace Dynamics* today announced *MySpatial Life*, a revolutionary life simulation where an AI-powered virtual family takes up permanent residence in your home. Traditional life sims confine characters to screens, breaking immersion when devices close. MySpatial Life leverages spatial computing to create family members who live continuously in your space - they sleep in your spare room, eat breakfast at your table, and develop careers while you're at work. Each family member evolves unique personalities through advanced AI, forming complex relationships and experiencing life events that unfold whether you're watching or not.

```yaml
ai_spatial_analysis:
  spatial_problem:
    limitation_of_2d: "Sims exist only when game is open"
    physical_constraints: "No connection to player's real life"
    missed_opportunities: "Persistent presence creates deeper bonds"
    
  spatial_solution:
    3d_advantage: "24/7 family life in your home"
    immersion_level: mixed
    interaction_paradigm: "Natural family interactions"
    presence_factor: very_high
```

**Customer quote**
"*Every morning, teenage daughter Emma is studying at my kitchen table while dad Michael makes virtual coffee. When I return from work, they've lived full days - Emma might have drama with friends, Michael got promoted. It feels like having roommates with their own lives, not just game characters.*" — *Lisa Chen, Product Manager and Gamer*.

```yaml
ai_parse:
  spatial_benefit: "Continuous life simulation creates real relationships"
  before_visionpro: "Paused characters on screens"
  after_visionpro: "Living AI family members"
  wow_factor: "They live full lives while you're away"
```

**Spatial Experience**
Players begin by welcoming their virtual family, who immediately explore and claim spaces in your home. Watch personalities emerge as the teenage son sets up his guitar in the corner, mom creates an art studio by the window, and toddler plays with toys near the couch. Family members follow realistic schedules - eating meals, pursuing hobbies, and interacting based on evolving relationships. Players influence lives through conversations, gift-giving, and life advice, but family members make autonomous decisions. Drama unfolds naturally - siblings argue, parents worry about careers, and everyone grows older in real-time.

```yaml
ai_spatial_flow:
  entry_experience: "Family moves into your home"
  core_interactions:
    - {gesture: "Conversation", action: "Natural speaking distance", spatial_feedback: "Emotional responses"}
    - {gesture: "Gift giving", action: "Hand objects to family", spatial_feedback: "Relationship building"}
    - {gesture: "Guidance", action: "Point to suggest activities", spatial_feedback: "Autonomous decisions"}
  spatial_anchoring: "Family members bound to home spaces"
  comfort_design: "Calm domestic life, no sudden events"
```

**Pricing & availability**
*MySpatial Life launches Q3 2025 free-to-play with Premium Genetics at $14.99 unlocking advanced personalities. Life Events packs $4.99. Family expansion $9.99. Compatible with visionOS 1.0+.*

```yaml

  enterprise_pricing: ""
  launch_regions: ["United States", "Canada", "United Kingdom", "Australia"]
  visionos_requirement: "1.0+"
  other_requirements: ["Persistent anchoring", "Always-on processing"]
```

**Privacy & Spatial Data**

# Vision Pro Specific FAQ

## 1. Spatial Computing Value

### Why does this need to be a spatial app vs traditional 2D?
