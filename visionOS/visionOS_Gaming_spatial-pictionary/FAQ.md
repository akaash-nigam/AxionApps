## General Questions

### What is Spatial Pictionary?

Spatial Pictionary is a revolutionary 3D drawing and guessing game for Apple Vision Pro. Players create artwork in mid-air using hand gestures while others guess the subject from any angle. It combines the classic fun of Pictionary with the immersive possibilities of spatial computing.

### What makes Spatial Pictionary different from regular Pictionary?

Unlike traditional Pictionary where you draw on a 2D surface:
- **3D Creation**: Draw in true three-dimensional space
- **Multiple Angles**: Viewers can walk around your creation
- **Hand Tracking**: Use natural gestures, no controllers needed
- **Spatial Depth**: Add depth and perspective to your drawings
- **Rich Materials**: Choose from glowing, solid, sketch, neon, and particle effects

### Do I need any accessories to play?

No! Spatial Pictionary uses Vision Pro's built-in hand tracking. No controllers, pens, or additional hardware required. Just your hands and creativity!

### Is Spatial Pictionary suitable for children?

Yes! Spatial Pictionary is rated 4+ and is perfect for:
- **Family game nights** - Ages 8 and up can play together
- **Educational use** - Great for vocabulary building
- **Creative development** - Encourages 3D spatial thinking

Parental supervision recommended for younger children using Vision Pro.

### Can I play Spatial Pictionary alone?

Yes! While Spatial Pictionary is designed for multiplayer fun, you can:
- **Practice mode**: Draw and improve your skills
- **AI opponent**: Play against AI guessers
- **Gallery mode**: Create and save 3D art

But the most fun happens with friends and family!
