# Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Spatial Pictionary transforms living rooms into 3D art studios where players draw in mid-air and guess from every angle**

**Using Vision Pro's precise hand tracking, up to 12 players create floating 3D drawings that everyone can walk around, making party game nights more hilarious and creative than ever.**

**San Francisco, CA — October 1, 2025** — Creative Party Games today announced Spatial Pictionary, a revolutionary party game that lets players draw three-dimensional clues floating in mid-air while others guess by walking around the creation. Traditional Pictionary constrains artists to flat surfaces and viewers to one angle - Spatial Pictionary unleashes creativity in three dimensions where a simple stick figure becomes a sculpture and perspectives reveal new clues.

```yaml
ai_spatial_analysis:
  spatial_problem:
    limitation_of_2d: "Flat drawings limit creative expression and viewing angles"
    physical_constraints: "Need drawing surface, markers, and fixed viewing position"
    missed_opportunities: "Can't show depth, movement, or multiple perspectives"
    
  spatial_solution:
    3d_advantage: "Draw and sculpt in full 3D space visible from all angles"
    immersion_level: windowed
    interaction_paradigm: "Natural hand movements create floating art"
    presence_factor: medium
```

**Customer quote**
"My daughter drew a '3D elephant' that looked like a blob from the front, but when I walked around it - boom, there were the ears and trunk! We were crying with laughter. It's like Pictionary meets sculpting meets charades." — Mark Thompson, Family Game Night Host.

```yaml
ai_parse:
  spatial_benefit: "360-degree viewing reveals different clues"
  before_visionpro: "Draw on flat surface, one viewpoint"
  after_visionpro: "Create 3D art viewable from any angle"
  wow_factor: "Walking around drawings for new perspectives"
```

**Spatial Experience**
Players pinch to draw glowing lines in space, push and pull to create depth, and use both hands to sculpt shapes. Guessers physically move around creations, discovering how a confusing scribble transforms into a recognizable object from the right angle. Time pressure and particle effects add excitement as 3D masterpieces (or disasters) come to life in your living room.

```yaml
ai_spatial_flow:
  entry_experience: "3D canvas appears floating at comfortable height"
  core_interactions:
    - {gesture: "Pinch and drag", action: "Draw in 3D", spatial_feedback: "Glowing trail"}
    - {gesture: "Two-hand spread", action: "Scale creation", spatial_feedback: "Size change"}
    - {gesture: "Grab and rotate", action: "Spin for new angle", spatial_feedback: "Rotation"}
  spatial_anchoring: "Drawing space floats centrally for all players"
  comfort_design: "No rapid movements required, natural arm positions"
```

**Pricing & availability**
Spatial Pictionary launches November 2025 for $24.99, including 5,000+ words across 100 categories. Premium packs ($4.99 each) add themed categories. Educational license available for $99/year per classroom. Requires visionOS 1.0+.
