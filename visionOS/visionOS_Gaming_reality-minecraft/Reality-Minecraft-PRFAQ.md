# Press Release (1 page max, 400-600 words)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Headline:** *Reality Minecraft* lets players build persistent block worlds in their actual homes, turning living spaces into evolving creative sandboxes

```yaml
ai_parse:
  app_name: "Reality Minecraft"
  spatial_transformation: "Homes become buildable block worlds"
  target_user: "Minecraft fans and creative builders"
  spatial_value: "Persistent constructions in real space"
```

**Sub-headline:** *Using Vision Pro's spatial anchoring and persistent world technology, players mine virtual resources from real walls, build structures that remain between sessions, and survive nights when digital monsters emerge from actual closets.*

```yaml
ai_parse:
  key_visionpro_feature: spatial_anchoring
  spatial_differentiator: "Persistent building in physical space"
  replaced_experience: "Screen-based Minecraft"
```

**Cupertino, CA — January 20, 2025** — *BlockSpace Studios* today announced *Reality Minecraft*, a spatial building game that permanently transforms homes into creative block worlds. Traditional Minecraft confines creativity to screens, disconnecting builds from reality. Reality Minecraft leverages spatial computing to overlay a persistent voxel layer on your actual space - mine virtual ore from real walls, build structures anchored to your floor, and defend against creatures emerging from dark corners. Constructions persist between sessions, gradually transforming your home into a personalized block universe that grows and evolves over months of play.

```yaml
ai_spatial_analysis:
  spatial_problem:
    limitation_of_2d: "Minecraft worlds exist only on screens"
    physical_constraints: "No connection to real environment"
    missed_opportunities: "Building in actual living space"
    
  spatial_solution:
    3d_advantage: "Persistent construction in real home"
    immersion_level: mixed
    interaction_paradigm: "Natural building with hand gestures"
    presence_factor: very_high
```

**Customer quote**
"*My kids built a castle wall along our hallway that's been growing for three months. Every morning they add new sections before school. When zombies emerge from the basement at night, the whole family defends our real home. It's Minecraft but actually living in it.*" — *Robert Kim, Parent and Builder*.

```yaml
ai_parse:
  spatial_benefit: "Living inside your Minecraft world"
  before_visionpro: "Separate digital worlds on screens"
  after_visionpro: "Home becomes the game world"
  wow_factor: "Persistent builds last months/years"
```

**Spatial Experience**
Players begin by scanning their home, revealing mineral deposits in walls and floors. Using hand gestures, they mine resources, craft tools, and place blocks that snap to real surfaces. Builds persist indefinitely - that bridge between couch and table remains next session. Day/night cycles bring survival elements as creatures spawn from dark areas. Multiplayer allows collaborative building, with friends contributing to your permanent home world. Advanced players create elaborate contraptions, automated farms, and defensive fortifications integrated with real architecture.

```yaml
ai_spatial_flow:
  entry_experience: "Home reveals hidden block resources"
  core_interactions:
    - {gesture: "Mining", action: "Punch motion extracts blocks", spatial_feedback: "Particle effects and collection"}
    - {gesture: "Building", action: "Place blocks with pinch", spatial_feedback: "Snap-to-grid construction"}
    - {gesture: "Crafting", action: "Combine items in space", spatial_feedback: "Creation animations"}
  spatial_anchoring: "All builds permanently anchored"
  comfort_design: "Calm pacing, optional combat, seated play supported"
```

**Pricing & availability**
*Reality Minecraft launches Q2 2025 at $39.99 with Realms+ subscription at $7.99/month for multiplayer and weekly content. Builder packs from $4.99. Compatible with visionOS 1.0+ requiring persistent anchors.*

```yaml
ai_pricing:
  app_store_price: "$39.99"
  iap_options: ["$7.99/month Realms+", "$4.99-14.99 builder packs"]
  enterprise_pricing: "Educational licenses available"
  launch_regions: ["Global launch"]
  visionos_requirement: "1.0+"
  other_requirements: ["Persistent spatial anchors", "2x2m minimum space"]
```

**Privacy & Spatial Data**
*Home mapping for block placement remains entirely on-device. Build data backs up to private iCloud. Multiplayer uses encrypted connections. No spatial data sharing.*

```yaml
ai_privacy:
  spatial_data_collected: [room_mapping, build_locations]
  data_stays_on_device: true
  cloud_processing: ["Encrypted build backup only"]
  user_controls: [local_only_mode, backup_toggle, multiplayer_permissions]
