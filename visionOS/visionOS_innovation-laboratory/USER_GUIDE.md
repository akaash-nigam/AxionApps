- Include visual references
- Tag appropriately

❌ **DON'T:**
- Wait to "fully form" ideas (capture raw thoughts)
- Overthink categories (can change later)
- Dismiss "wild" ideas
- Duplicate existing ideas (search first)

### Prototype Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Start simple, iterate quickly
- Test early and often
- Document learnings
- Share with stakeholders
- Version control

❌ **DON'T:**
- Perfect the first version
- Skip testing phases
- Work in isolation
- Ignore feedback
- Over-engineer

### Collaboration Tips

✅ **DO:**
- Use spatial audio for natural conversation
- Point and gesture to communicate
- Share context before inviting
- Record important sessions
- Follow up with notes

❌ **DON'T:**
- Talk over each other
- Edit without coordinating
- Work on too many things at once
- Forget to save changes
- Ignore team input

### Performance Optimization

- Close unused windows/volumes
- Archive old ideas regularly
- Clear cache periodically
- Limit simultaneous prototypes
- Restart app if sluggish
