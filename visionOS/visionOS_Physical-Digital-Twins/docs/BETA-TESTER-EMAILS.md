Hi [Name],

I hope this email finds you well!

I'm excited to share that I've been working on **Physical-Digital Twins**, a brand new inventory management app designed exclusively for Apple Vision Pro. It helps you catalog, organize, and track your physical possessions using the power of spatial computing.

**I'm looking for beta testers**, and I immediately thought of you! Here's why I think you'd be perfect:

- You're an early adopter with Vision Pro
- You have collections/inventory to manage (books, tools, collectibles, etc.)
- You provide thoughtful, actionable feedback
- You're excited about spatial computing

**What Beta Testing Involves:**

✓ Install the app via TestFlight (free)
✓ Use it for your real inventory (books, items, etc.)
✓ Test features and report any bugs you find
✓ Share your honest feedback and suggestions
✓ Commitment: ~2-3 hours over 2-3 weeks

**What You'll Get:**

✨ Early access to all features
✨ Direct line to the developer (that's me!)
✨ Shape the product before public launch
✨ Free lifetime access (no in-app purchases)
✨ Special "Beta Tester" credit in the app

**Interested?**

Just reply with "I'm in!" and I'll send you a TestFlight invitation within 24 hours.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I really appreciate you considering this!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. Know someone else who'd be interested? Feel free to forward this!
