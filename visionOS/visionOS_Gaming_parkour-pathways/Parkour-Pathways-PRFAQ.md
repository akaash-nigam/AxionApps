# Press Release (1 page max, 400-600 words)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Headline:** *Parkour Pathways* transforms living spaces into ever-changing obstacle courses that turn everyday fitness into thrilling athletic adventures

```yaml
ai_parse:
  app_name: "Parkour Pathways"
  spatial_transformation: "Homes become dynamic training courses"
  target_user: "Fitness enthusiasts and movement athletes"
  spatial_value: "Real environment becomes athletic playground"
```

**Sub-headline:** *Using Vision Pro's room understanding and object detection, virtual obstacles blend with real furniture to create personalized parkour courses that evolve with your skills and space.*

```yaml
ai_parse:
  key_visionpro_feature: object_detection
  spatial_differentiator: "Real furniture integrated into courses"
  replaced_experience: "Static gym equipment and outdoor courses"
```

**Cupertino, CA — January 20, 2025** — *FlowState Fitness* today announced *Parkour Pathways*, a revolutionary fitness platform that transforms any indoor space into intelligent obstacle courses. Traditional fitness games ignore your actual environment, missing opportunities for creative movement. Parkour Pathways leverages spatial computing to analyze your room and generate custom courses - virtual walls to vault appear at couch height, precision landing targets utilize actual floor space, and holographic rails extend from real furniture for flow sequences. The system adapts difficulty based on your performance, ensuring constant challenge as skills improve.

```yaml
ai_spatial_analysis:
  spatial_problem:
    limitation_of_2d: "Exercise videos can't use your space"
    physical_constraints: "Gym equipment expensive and static"
    missed_opportunities: "Home environment underutilized for fitness"
    
  spatial_solution:
    3d_advantage: "Every room becomes unique course"
    immersion_level: mixed
    interaction_paradigm: "Athletic movement in real space"
    presence_factor: high
```

**Customer quote**
"*My coffee table became a vault box, the hallway turned into a precision corridor, and suddenly my boring apartment was an athletic playground. After a month, I'm doing movements I never thought possible, and I've never been more fit.*" — *Alex Chen, Parkour Athlete and Beta Tester*.

```yaml
ai_parse:
  spatial_benefit: "Home environment becomes training facility"
  before_visionpro: "Traveling to gyms or outdoor spots"
  after_visionpro: "Professional training in any space"
  wow_factor: "Furniture becomes athletic equipment"
```

**Spatial Experience**
Sessions begin with room scanning, identifying surfaces, gaps, and flow possibilities. Virtual elements appear color-coded by difficulty - green for beginner, progressing to red for advanced. Players navigate courses combining real and virtual obstacles: leap virtual gaps between furniture, wall-run on holographic surfaces, and land on precision targets. Real-time form analysis provides coaching, while ghost recordings show optimal paths. Multiplayer races let friends compete on synchronized courses adapted to each player's space.

```yaml
ai_spatial_flow:
  entry_experience: "Room analysis creates custom course"
  core_interactions:
    - {gesture: "Vaulting", action: "Hand placement on surfaces", spatial_feedback: "Technique scoring"}
    - {gesture: "Wall running", action: "Lateral movement tracking", spatial_feedback: "Speed metrics"}
    - {gesture: "Precision jumps", action: "Landing accuracy", spatial_feedback: "Balance indicators"}
  spatial_anchoring: "Obstacles locked to room geometry"
  comfort_design: "Progressive difficulty, safety boundaries"
```

**Pricing & availability**
*Parkour Pathways launches Q2 2025 at $29.99 with Flow+ subscription at $9.99/month for unlimited courses and coaching. Annual passes $79.99. Compatible with visionOS 1.0+ requiring full room scanning.*

```yaml
ai_pricing:
  app_store_price: "$29.99"
  iap_options: ["$9.99/month Flow+ subscription", "$79.99/year annual pass"]
  enterprise_pricing: "Fitness studio licenses available"
  launch_regions: ["United States", "France", "Australia", "Japan"]
  visionos_requirement: "1.0+"
  other_requirements: ["Room scanning", "2.5x2.5m minimum space"]
```

**Privacy & Spatial Data**
*Room geometry processed locally for course generation. Movement data for form analysis stays on-device. Optional fitness tracking syncs with HealthKit. No video recording or transmission.*

```yaml
ai_privacy:
  spatial_data_collected: [room_geometry, movement_patterns, health_metrics]
  data_stays_on_device: true
  cloud_processing: ["Anonymous leaderboards only"]
  user_controls: [data_deletion, offline_mode, health_sync_toggle]
