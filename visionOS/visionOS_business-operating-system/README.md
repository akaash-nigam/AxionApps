- **Intuitive** instead of training-intensive
- **Insightful** instead of report-based
- **Collaborative** instead of siloed
- **Predictive** instead of historical
- **Joyful** instead of painful

## Next Steps

1. **Validate**: Interview 50 target customers
2. **Prototype**: Build spatial CRM demo
3. **Pilot**: Deploy with 3 beta customers
4. **Raise**: Close seed round
5. **Scale**: Transform enterprise software forever
