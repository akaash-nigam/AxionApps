# Reality Annotation Platform

> Persistent spatial annotations for Apple Vision Pro

## Overview

Reality Annotation Platform enables users to leave virtual notes in physical space that persist over time, appear at specific times or conditions, and have different visibility for different people—creating a layer of digital information overlaid on the physical world.

## Key Features

- **Spatial Notes & Annotations** - Leave text, drawings, photos, voice memos in space
- **Time-Based Visibility** - Annotations appear/disappear based on time or conditions
- **Multi-User Permissions** - Control who can see, edit, or delete annotations
- **Spatial Layers & Channels** - Organize annotations into thematic layers
- **Search & Discovery** - Find annotations by location, content, or creator
- **Collaboration & Comments** - Enable conversations around annotations

## Target Users

- Families (home notes)
- Property Managers (maintenance tracking)
- Event Planners (setup instructions)
- Teachers (classroom overlays)
- Museums (exhibition curation)

## Market Opportunity

- AR/VR content market: $300B by 2028
