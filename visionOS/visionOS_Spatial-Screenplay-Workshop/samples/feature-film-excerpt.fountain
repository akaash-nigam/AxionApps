# ACT I

===

FADE IN:

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

Endless blue stretches to the horizon. A research vessel, the TRITON, bobs in gentle swells.

SUPER: "200 MILES OFF THE COAST OF HAWAII"

INT. TRITON - SUBMERSIBLE BAY - DAY

DR. JAMES RIVERS (40, marine biologist with kind eyes and sun-worn skin) suits up in a dive suit. His hands work automatically - he's done this a thousand times.

His daughter, EMMA (16, eager and brilliant), helps him check seals.

EMMA
Dad, are you sure about this? The sonar readings don't make sense.

JAMES
Since when has that stopped us?

EMMA
Since never. That's what worries me.

She shows him a tablet. The sonar image displays an impossible structure - geometric and massive - six miles down.

JAMES
(studying it)
Could be a volcanic formation.

EMMA
(skeptical)
A perfectly square volcanic formation?

CAPTAIN REEVES (50s, grizzled), oversees the launch preparations.

CAPTAIN REEVES
Dr. Rivers, we should wait for the Navy team. They'll be here in twelve hours.

JAMES
And in twelve hours, that storm system will be here. This is our only window.

He climbs into the submersible - a sleek titanium sphere called ORPHEUS.

JAMES (CONT'D)
(to Emma)
Monitor the descent. If anything looks wrong—

EMMA
I know, Dad. Three rapid pings means abort.

They share a moment. The hatch closes.

CAPTAIN REEVES
Launching Orpheus.

The crane lifts the sub and lowers it into the churning water.

INT. ORPHEUS - CONTINUOUS

James settles into the pilot's seat. Controls glow around him. The viewport shows bubbles and then... darkness.

JAMES
(into comm)
Orpheus to Triton. Beginning descent. All systems green.

EMMA (V.O.)
Copy that, Orpheus. We have you on sonar.

The depth gauge climbs: 100 meters... 500 meters... 1,000 meters...

EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

The sub descends through layers of light. Blue becomes black.

INT. ORPHEUS - CONTINUOUS

James activates exterior lights. Strange fish dart past - creatures that exist nowhere else on Earth.

JAMES
Passing 3,000 meters. Temperature dropping. Pressure nominal.

4,000 meters...

A massive shape glides through the darkness - something enormous. James can't make out details, just a shadow darker than the abyss.

JAMES (CONT'D)
Did you see that?

EMMA (V.O.)
(concerned)
See what? Sonar shows nothing.

JAMES
I... never mind. Continuing descent.

5,000 meters...

The sonar pings. Something appears ahead.

JAMES (CONT'D)
I'm getting a visual on the structure.

He adjusts the lights. They illuminate...

A wall. Smooth, metallic, covered in symbols that are definitely not natural.

JAMES (CONT'D)
(whisper)
My god...

EMMA (V.O.)
Dad? What is it?

JAMES
It's not volcanic, Emma. It's a building.

The lights trace the wall - it extends in all directions. Massive. Ancient.

JAMES (CONT'D)
Someone built a city. Six miles underwater. And it's older than anything we've ever found.

He maneuvers the sub along the wall. An opening appears - an archway, perfectly preserved.

EMMA (V.O.)
Dad, your oxygen is at 80%. You should ascend.

JAMES
Just a few more minutes.

He pilots through the archway.

INT. UNDERWATER CITY - CONTINUOUS

His lights reveal an impossible sight - buildings, streets, plazas. All perfectly intact. All underwater for... how long?

Something glows in the distance. Pulsing. Blue light.

JAMES
There's a power source. After all this time, something is still on.

EMMA (V.O.)
(urgent)
Dad, you need to come up NOW. We're reading a pressure change in your sector.

JAMES
What kind of change?

A deep RUMBLE. The city vibrates.

EMMA (V.O.)
Seismic activity! Get out of there!

James spins the sub around. The archway is collapsing.

JAMES
I can't! I'm trapped!

The blue light grows brighter. Closer.

Buildings shift. Ancient mechanisms activate.

And then - silence.

The blue light surrounds the sub. James' instruments go haywire.

JAMES (CONT'D)
Triton, do you copy? Triton?

Static.

He's alone. Six miles beneath the waves. In a city that shouldn't exist.

With something that's waking up.

CUT TO BLACK.
