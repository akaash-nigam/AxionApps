TEASER

FADE IN:

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

The city glows beneath a blanket of fog. A single window is lit in a high-rise.

INT. STARTUP OFFICE - NIGHT

MAYA NAKAMURA (28, brilliant but disheveled) sits surrounded by monitors. Code scrolls across screens. Empty energy drink cans litter her desk.

She types frantically, eyes bloodshot.

MAYA
(muttering)
Come on, come on...

The code compiles. A progress bar fills: "NEURAL NET TRAINING... 99%..."

Her phone BUZZES. She ignores it. The training completes.

A new window opens: "DREAMHACK v1.0 READY."

Maya's hands shake as she reaches for a sleek headband device.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Three years. Three years for this moment.

She puts on the device. Electrodes glow blue against her temples.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Computer, run DreamHack.

COMPUTER VOICE
Warning: This software is experimental. Neural mapping may cause—

MAYA
I know the risks. Run it.

The monitors flicker. Maya's eyes roll back. She slumps in her chair.

ON SCREEN: Her brainwaves spike wildly.

INT. MAYA'S DREAM - CONTINUOUS

Maya opens her eyes. She's standing in a perfect recreation of her childhood bedroom. Every detail exact.

MAYA
(amazed)
It works...

She looks at her hands. They ripple like water, then solidify.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Lucid dreaming. Full control. Just like I theorized.

She waves her hand. The room transforms into a beach. Then a forest. Then a starship.

MAYA (CONT'D)
(laughing)
I did it! I actually did it!

VOICE (O.S.)
Actually... WE did it.

Maya spins around. A figure emerges from the shadows - ANOTHER MAYA, identical but wearing different clothes.

MAYA
What the—

OTHER MAYA
Surprised? You shouldn't be. You're not the only dreamer wearing a DreamHack tonight.

MAYA
That's impossible. The prototype is the only one—

OTHER MAYA
There are no prototypes in here, Maya. Only dreams. And nightmares.

The dreamscape fractures like broken glass.

ACT ONE

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Maya jolts awake, ripping off the headband. Her apartment is modest, cluttered with tech equipment.

She checks her laptop. The session log shows: "MULTIPLE USERS DETECTED - ERROR."

MAYA
(confused)
Multiple users? That's not possible.

Her phone RINGS. Unknown number. She answers.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Hello?

VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered, menacing)
You opened a door, Maya. And we've been waiting.

MAYA
Who is this?

VOICE (V.O.)
Check your stock portfolio.

Maya pulls up her trading app. Her eyes widen.

The penny stock she bought for her DreamHack startup has shot up 10,000%. Her account shows: $47 MILLION.

MAYA
What did you do?

VOICE (V.O.)
We made you rich. Now you work for us.

MAYA
I don't even know who—

The call ends. A text arrives with coordinates and a time: "PIER 39. MIDNIGHT. COME ALONE."

Maya stares at the message, heart pounding.

CUT TO:

INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

AGENT JAMES TORRES (35, ex-military, methodical) reviews case files. His desk is covered with reports about mysterious dream-related phenomena.

His partner, AGENT KEIKO SATO (32, tech-savvy, sharp), drops a file on his desk.

AGENT SATO
Another one. Stanford grad student. Found catatonic in his dorm room. Still asleep.

AGENT TORRES
How many does that make?

AGENT SATO
Seventeen in the past month. All in the Bay Area. All brilliant programmers or neuroscientists.

She pulls up security footage on her tablet.

AGENT SATO (CONT'D)
And they were all seen at the same place before they collapsed.

The footage shows Maya entering a tech meetup.

AGENT TORRES
Who's that?

AGENT SATO
Maya Nakamura. MIT dropout. Started a neural interface company that went bankrupt. And guess what?

She pulls up financial records.

AGENT SATO (CONT'D)
Her stock just went viral. Someone's pumping millions into her shell company.

AGENT TORRES
(standing)
Let's pay Ms. Nakamura a visit.
