INT. ABANDONED SPACE STATION - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

Flickering emergency lights cast long shadows across the room. Dust particles float in zero gravity.

CAPTAIN CHEN (40s, weathered but determined) floats toward an ancient communications console, her magnetic boots clicking off.

CAPTAIN CHEN
(to herself)
One message. That's all I need.

She activates the console. The screen flickers to life, displaying: "SIGNAL WEAK - 2% POWER REMAINING."

CAPTAIN CHEN (CONT'D)
Come on, old friend. Just one more time.

Her fingers dance across the controls. Static fills the room.

STATIC VOICE (V.O.)
(barely audible)
...Station 7... do you copy?

Chen's eyes widen. She grabs the microphone with trembling hands.

CAPTAIN CHEN
(urgent)
Station 7, this is Odyssey actual! We're alive! We're still alive!

Long pause. Only static.

STATIC VOICE (V.O.)
Odyssey... confirmed lost... fourteen months ago... Who is this?

CAPTAIN CHEN
(desperate)
It's Chen! Captain Sarah Chen! I'm the only survivor, but I found something. Something important.

She pulls a data chip from her pocket, holding it up to catch the light.

CAPTAIN CHEN (CONT'D)
The coordinates to the source. Everything we've been looking for...

STATIC VOICE (V.O.)
Your position?

Chen looks at the navigation display - it shows deep space, impossibly far from home.

CAPTAIN CHEN
(quiet)
Too far. Life support failing. But I can transmit the data.

She inserts the chip into the console. A progress bar appears: "UPLOADING 1%... 2%..."

STATIC VOICE (V.O.)
Chen, hold on. We're sending a rescue—

CAPTAIN CHEN
No time. Tell my daughter... tell her I found it. Tell her mom found the stars.

The power indicator drops to 1%. The upload reaches 98%.

Chen watches, holding her breath. The lights flicker.

99%...

The screen goes black. Emergency lights die. Total darkness.

Then - a soft BEEP. One tiny green light on the console.

"UPLOAD COMPLETE."

Chen smiles in the darkness.

CAPTAIN CHEN
(whisper)
See you on the other side, starlight.

She closes her eyes as the last of the oxygen hisses away.

FADE TO BLACK.
