# Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Reality Realms transforms every home into a persistent fantasy RPG world where furniture becomes gameplay and adventures evolve uniquely in YOUR space**

**Using Vision Pro's room mapping and spatial anchors, players defend their actual living spaces from magical invasions while building persistent defenses that remain exactly where placed.**

**Cupertino, CA — September 15, 2025** — Mythic Studios today announced Reality Realms, a spatial RPG that transforms players' homes into living game worlds where magical portals connect rooms to fantasy dimensions. Unlike traditional RPGs confined to screens, Reality Realms creates persistent adventures that adapt to each player's unique home layout, with furniture affecting combat tactics and virtual creatures that remember where they live in your space.

```yaml
ai_spatial_analysis:
  spatial_problem:
    limitation_of_2d: "RPGs can't utilize player's physical environment"
    physical_constraints: "Screen-based games create separation from adventure"
    missed_opportunities: "Home spaces unused for persistent gameplay"
    
  spatial_solution:
    3d_advantage: "Every room becomes a different realm with unique properties"
    immersion_level: mixed
    interaction_paradigm: "Natural movement and gestures for combat/magic"
    presence_factor: high
```

**Customer quote**
"My couch is now literally my castle's defensive wall, and the goblin I befriended lives under my coffee table. When friends visit, they can see and interact with MY unique realm. This isn't just playing an RPG - it's living in one." — Sarah Chen, Beta Player.

```yaml
ai_parse:
  spatial_benefit: "Physical space becomes persistent game world"
  before_visionpro: "Play RPGs on screen, separate from reality"
  after_visionpro: "Live inside RPG that adapts to your actual home"
  wow_factor: "Virtual creatures living persistently in real spaces"
```

**Spatial Experience**
Players use natural sword-swinging gestures for combat, physically dodge enemy attacks by moving in their room, and cast spells by drawing symbols in the air. The game remembers where everything is placed - your magical sword stays leaning against your real wall, and NPCs follow daily routines moving through your actual living space.

```yaml
ai_spatial_flow:
  entry_experience: "Portal opens in your room, revealing realm overlay"
  core_interactions:
    - {gesture: "Sword swing", action: "Melee combat", spatial_feedback: "Haptic impact"}
    - {gesture: "Palm push", action: "Cast shield", spatial_feedback: "Visual barrier"}
    - {gesture: "Draw symbols", action: "Cast spells", spatial_feedback: "Particle effects"}
  spatial_anchoring: "All game objects persist relative to real furniture"
  comfort_design: "Combat telegraphs allow reaction without quick movements"
```

**Pricing & availability**
Reality Realms launches January 2026 for $59.99 on App Store, with optional Realm Pass subscription ($9.99/month) for new monthly realms and exclusive content. Requires visionOS 1.0+ and Vision Pro with room scanning.
