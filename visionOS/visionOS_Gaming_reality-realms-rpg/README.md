# Reality Realms - The Living Room RPG

## Tagline
"Your Home. Your Adventure. Your Legend."

## Overview
Reality Realms transforms your actual living space into a persistent RPG world. Every room becomes a different realm, every piece of furniture affects gameplay, and the adventure evolves uniquely in YOUR home.

## Core Concept

### The Premise
Magical portals have opened in homes across the world. Your house is now connected to fantasy realms that overlay your real space. As a Realm Guardian, you must:
- Defend your home from invasions
- Explore magical dimensions in familiar spaces
- Build defenses that persist in your room
- Unite with neighbors to save the world

5. **Grows Over Time**: Your home becomes more magical daily

## Technical Innovation

### Spatial Mapping
```swift
struct RealmMapper {
    func analyzeHome() -> HomeLayout {
        // Scan rooms and create game map
        // Identify furniture for gameplay
        // Set spawn points safely
        // Create navigation mesh
    }
}
```

### Persistence System
```swift
struct PersistentRealm {
    let realmID: UUID
    var rooms: [RoomID: RealmRoom]
    var entities: [Entity]
    var playerProgress: Progress
    
    func saveState() {
        // Cloud sync all positions
        // Remember player actions
        // Track realm evolution
    }
}
```

### Adaptive Difficulty
```swift
struct DifficultyManager {
    func adjustToSpace(size: RoomDimensions) -> Difficulty {
        // Smaller rooms = tactical combat
        // Larger rooms = more enemies
        // Furniture density affects strategy
    }
}
```
