# Press Release (1 page max, 400-600 words)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Headline:** *Hide and Seek Evolved* revolutionizes the timeless game with spatial superpowers, letting players become invisible, shapeshift into furniture, and hide across dimensional layers

```yaml
ai_parse:
  app_name: "Hide and Seek Evolved"
  spatial_transformation: "Homes become multi-dimensional playgrounds"
  target_user: "Families, friends, and party game enthusiasts"
  spatial_value: "Impossible hiding mechanics in real space"
```

**Sub-headline:** *Using Vision Pro's spatial tracking and shared experiences, players master supernatural hiding abilities while seekers use high-tech detection tools in thrilling cat-and-mouse battles throughout their homes.*

```

**Cupertino, CA — January 20, 2025** — *PlaySpace Interactive* today announced *Hide and Seek Evolved*, a magical reimagining of the classic game that transforms homes into supernatural hunting grounds. Traditional hide and seek limits players to physical concealment behind furniture. Hide and Seek Evolved leverages spatial computing to grant hiders extraordinary abilities - become translucent and blend with walls, shapeshift to mimic household objects, or slip into parallel dimensions visible only through special seeker tools. Seekers gain equally powerful detection abilities, creating strategic battles of deception and discovery impossible in reality.

```yaml
ai_spatial_analysis:
  spatial_problem:
    limitation_of_2d: "Video games lack physical hiding thrill"
    physical_constraints: "Real hiding spots quickly exhausted"
    missed_opportunities: "Spatial tech enables impossible mechanics"
    
  spatial_solution:
    3d_advantage: "Supernatural abilities in real space"
    immersion_level: mixed
    interaction_paradigm: "Physical movement with digital powers"
    presence_factor: very_high
```

**Customer quote**
"*My daughter shapeshifted into our coffee table while I walked past three times. When I finally used my heat vision and caught her, we were both laughing hysterically. It's like the game we played as kids but with superpowers we always imagined.*" — *Jennifer Park, Parent and Beta Tester*.

```yaml
ai_parse:
  spatial_benefit: "Childhood imagination made real through spatial tech"
  before_visionpro: "Limited to physical hiding spots"
  after_visionpro: "Supernatural hiding and seeking abilities"
  wow_factor: "Shapeshifting into actual furniture"
```

**Spatial Experience**
Games begin with role selection - hiders gain abilities like invisibility cloaking (90% transparent), object mimicry (become any scanned furniture), and dimensional phasing (hide in parallel layer). Seekers receive tools including heat vision, motion trackers, and dimensional scanners. The home becomes a multilayered battlefield where hiders might be disguised as your bookshelf, phased into a shadow dimension, or leaving false holographic decoys. Rounds intensify as abilities upgrade and new powers unlock.

```yaml
