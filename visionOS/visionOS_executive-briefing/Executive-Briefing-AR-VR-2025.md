### 2. **Build vs. Buy vs. Partner**
**Decision Framework**:
```
Core Differentiator? → Build
Industry Standard? → Buy
Emerging Capability? → Partner
```

**Recommendation**: Partner for 2025 pilots, build core IP by 2026

### 3. **Data & Privacy Architecture**
**Critical Choice**: Edge computing vs. cloud processing

**Recommendation**: 
- Edge-first for biometric data

## Conclusion: The Spatial Imperative

The transition to spatial computing is not optional—it's inevitable. The only question is whether your organization will lead, follow, or be left behind. 2025 is the year when AR/VR moves from experimental to essential.

**Three Critical Actions**:
1. **Commit**: Make spatial computing a board-level priority
2. **Invest**: Allocate sufficient resources to compete
3. **Execute**: Move fast and learn faster

**Remember**: Every transformative technology follows the same pattern—dismissal, experimentation, adoption, dominance. AR/VR has entered the adoption phase. By 2027, leaders will be established and barriers to entry will be insurmountable.

**The time to act is now.**
