# Spatial Code Reviewer

> Transform code review into an immersive 3D spatial experience for Apple Vision Pro

## Overview

Spatial Code Reviewer reimagines code review by visualizing code as floating 3D structures, dependency graphs as physical connections, and enabling team collaboration in spatial environments. Review code naturally by walking around it, see architectural relationships at a glance, and collaborate with remote team members as if they're in the same room.
