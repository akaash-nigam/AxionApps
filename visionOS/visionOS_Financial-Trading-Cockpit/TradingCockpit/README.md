## Key Classes & Protocols

### AppState
Global observable state for the application. Tracks authentication, selected securities, focus mode, and connection status.

### Logger
Centralized logging with levels: debug, info, warning, error, critical. Integrates with unified logging system.

### KeychainManager
Secure storage for authentication tokens and sensitive data. Uses iOS Keychain Services API.

### DatabaseManager
SQLite wrapper with core tables:
- `securities` - Security reference data
- `orders` - Order audit trail
- `positions` - Current positions
- `watchlists` - User watchlists

---

## Build Configuration

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Xcode 15.2+ installed
2. Apple Vision Pro device or simulator
3. Apple Developer account

### Setup Steps
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd visionOS_Financial-Trading-Cockpit

# 2. Open in Xcode
open TradingCockpit.xcodeproj  # (Will be created when building in Xcode)

# 3. Select target device
# - Apple Vision Pro (Device)
# - Apple Vision Pro (Simulator)

# 4. Build and run
# Cmd+R in Xcode
```

### API Keys (Coming in Sprint 2)
- Alpaca API Key (for paper trading)
- Polygon.io API Key (for market data)

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use `// MARK:` comments for organization
- Prefer structs over classes when possible
- Use `@Observable` for state management
- Use actors for thread-safe shared state

### Commit Messages
Follow Conventional Commits:
```
feat: add new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation
refactor: code restructuring
test: adding tests
```

### Testing
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API calls
- UI tests for critical flows

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Why `@Observable` instead of `@ObservableObject`?
Using Swift 5.9's new `@Observable` macro for cleaner, more performant state management.

### Why SQLite instead of Core Data?
Direct control over schema, better performance for financial data, simpler migration strategy.

### Why native frameworks only?
Minimizing dependencies keeps app lightweight, reduces security surface area, and improves App Store review chances.

---

## Security Notes

### Sensitive Data Handling
- ✅ Auth tokens stored in Keychain only
- ✅ No credentials in code or git
- ✅ Database is not encrypted (no sensitive data stored)
- ✅ Audit trail for all orders (SEC compliance)

### Best Practices
- Never log sensitive data
- Use HTTPS for all network calls
- Implement session timeout (15 minutes)
- Require re-auth for critical actions
