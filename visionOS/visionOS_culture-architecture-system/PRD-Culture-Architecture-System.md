# AI-Era Spatial Enterprise PRD: Culture Architecture System

## Section 1: Executive Summary & Spatial Vision

The Culture Architecture System transforms organizational culture from abstract values posters into living, breathing spatial experiences where employees navigate cultural landscapes, participate in values-driven simulations, collaborate in purpose-aligned environments, and leverage AI to measure and evolve cultural health in real-time. This spatial platform enables leaders to literally see culture patterns, design behavioral environments, and create self-reinforcing cultural systems that drive engagement, innovation, and sustainable performance.

### Strategic Vision
* **Business Transformation**: From static culture initiatives to dynamic cultural operating systems
* **Competitive Advantage**: 3x engagement through authentic cultural alignment
* **AI Integration**: Predictive cultural health with behavioral optimization
* **Platform Strategy**: Become the spatial OS for organizational culture transformation

### Key Stakeholders
* Chief Executive Officers
* Chief People Officers
* Culture Leaders
* Team Managers
* All Employees
* Board of Directors
