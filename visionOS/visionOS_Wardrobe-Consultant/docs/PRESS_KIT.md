## Press Release

### Wardrobe Consultant Launches: AI-Powered Style Assistant for Apple Vision Pro

**[City, Date]** - Today marks the launch of Wardrobe Consultant, a groundbreaking visionOS application that transforms how people interact with their wardrobes using artificial intelligence and color science. Designed exclusively for Apple Vision Pro and iOS devices, Wardrobe Consultant brings professional styling intelligence to everyday users.

**The Challenge**

The average person spends 15-20 minutes each morning deciding what to wear, often feeling dissatisfied with their choices. Despite having closets full of clothes, many struggle to create cohesive outfits, maximize their existing wardrobe, or make smart fashion purchases.

## Key Messages

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Wardrobe Consultant is your AI-powered style assistant that transforms your phone into a personal stylist. Snap photos of your clothes, and get instant outfit recommendations based on your style, the weather, and your calendar. It's like having a professional stylist, but privacy-first and available 24/7."

### Detailed Description (2 minutes)

"Getting dressed shouldn't be stressful, but many people spend 15-20 minutes each morning struggling with their closets. Wardrobe Consultant solves this by bringing professional styling intelligence to your device.

Here's how it works: You photograph your clothing items—just like you would to sell them online. The app automatically extracts details like colors and patterns. Then, our AI engine analyzes your wardrobe using the same principles professional stylists use: color harmony theory, style matching, and context awareness.

When you need an outfit, just tap a button. The app considers your personal style, today's weather, and even your upcoming calendar events to suggest perfect combinations. Each recommendation comes with a confidence score, so you know which outfits are truly optimal.

But it goes beyond just recommendations. The app tracks what you wear, calculates cost-per-wear for each item, and helps you identify underutilized pieces. This data-driven approach helps you make smarter shopping decisions and reduce fashion waste.

Everything runs locally on your device with bank-level encryption, so your personal style data remains completely private. No accounts required, no data sharing, no compromises.

Wardrobe Consultant—professional styling for everyone, with privacy as a priority."

### Key Differentiators

1. **Scientific Approach**: Uses actual color science (HSL color space) and styling algorithms, not just simple pattern matching
2. **Privacy-First**: All processing on-device, no cloud storage or data sharing
3. **Contextually Aware**: Considers weather, calendar events, and wear history—not just aesthetics
4. **Data-Driven**: Provides actionable insights on wardrobe usage and value
5. **Platform Native**: Built specifically for visionOS/iOS, not a cross-platform port
