# City Builder Tabletop
**Tagline:** "Transform any surface into a thriving metropolis"

## Overview
City Builder Tabletop revolutionizes urban planning simulation by allowing players to construct and manage entire cities on any flat surface using Vision Pro's spatial capabilities. Whether on your dining table, coffee table, or floor, watch as detailed 3D cities emerge and evolve, complete with traffic flow, citizen AI, and dynamic economic systems that respond to your architectural decisions in real-time.

## Core Gameplay Features

### Spatial City Construction
